# Molokai Color Scheme for Vim

Molokai is a Vim port of the monokai theme for TextMate originally created by Wimer Hazenberg.
By default, it has a dark gray background based on the version created by
Hamish Stuart Macpherson for the E editor. Screenshots of the original molokai are available
[here](http://winterdom.com/2008/08/molokaiforvim).

This is repository contains a version that best fits my needs.
